# Scaleformeter Script
**This is the script side of Scaleformeter, which is a speedometer resource entirely built from scaleforms.**

# Important Note
This resource requires the **scaleformeter_assets** resource to run, which you can find on Tebex [here](https://sapheneiastudios.tebex.io/package/6614768)!

# Features
- This is a standalone script
- Customizable
  - Position, scale & colour
- Not only can you use this speedometer in 2d, but you can also attach it to your car 3d!
- Since it uses GTA V's native UI, it's very performant, although the resource monitor will not reflect this since we're using C# which displays an overhead
- Includes handbrake, ABS, drift, speed (mph/kmh), gears and accelerator/brake indicators
- Kvp saving for the last selected speedo and the last known display state
